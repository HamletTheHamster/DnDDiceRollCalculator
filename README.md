# DnDDiceRollCalculator

### Documentation ###

This program assists in the dice rolling 
part of DnD play. If you have your own dice 
to use, you can still use this program to 
add up the rolls for you and apply bonuses,
all for as many people as you want. It can
also tell you who's total roll is the highest
for initiative rolls. All input is validated
for correctness to an extent, and the user
is given a message indicating what was wrong
if incorrect input is submitted. This program
attempts to be very natural in its 
communication with the user. It accepts a 
range of words for indicating yes or no and 
it reports all numbers with correct grammar 
(a vs an).
